## ELEC 327 - Digital Systems Laboratory (2025)

---

_One of the most critical aspects of modern computer systems involves interfacing with the
world. This course will focus on how power-efficient embedded systems are built. Students
should learn the fundamentals of embedded system programming and feel competent to design,
build, and manufacture their own embedded devices. Furthermore, students should understand
how embedded systems interface with external peripheral devices. Finally, students should
understand how application-specific blocks enable modern commercial devices._
