#### Part 1: Different Clocks, Low Power Mode, and PWM
For Lab 2, you learned how to switch the timer interrupt from the DCO to the VLO by, in part,
changing its source from the SMCLK to the ACLK. As discussed in class, the primary advantage of
the VLO is **much lower power** consumption than the DCO. It also is lower frequency, which can
be convenient if you want infrequent timer interrupts.

  1. **(Review, not scored)** Using the DCO, what is the minimum frequency for a timer
  interrupt? What is the typical default frequency of the VLO? How do you turn on the VLO, and
  how do you change code from last week to run off the VLO instead of the DCO?
  {: class="questions"}

LPM4 consumes very little power. I noticed, playing around with my Lab 2 pendant, that if I
removed the battery while in LPM4, the capacitor between power and ground held enough charge
to keep the device functioning (in LPM4) for at least a few seconds. To see this yourself,
remember that on first power up, the pendant will always start with LED1 illuminated. Start
it going, and then go into LPM4 when the next LED will _not_ be LED1. Remove the battery, wait
a while, then put the battery back and push the button again. You'll see that it will continue
on where it left off. If you push the button while it's asleep, you'll rapidly discharge the
capacitor and when you put the battery back in, it will start with LED1 again.

  2. **(WILL BE MOVED TO A LATER LAB THIS SEMESTER!)**
  According to the datasheet, power consumption in LPM4 is ~100 nA @ 2.2V. Let's assume we
  can model the device in LPM4 as a resistor. What is the resistance? Assume that right before
  you take the battery out, the capacitor is charged to 3V (i.e., battery voltage). Then, we
  can define the system as a capacitor discharging into a resistor. The brownout circuit will
  trigger a device reset when the power level drops too low. Let's assume that that value is
  1.35V. Finally, let's assume that the capacitor between power and ground which you soldered
  on is (actually) 10 ÂµF. How long will it take for the voltage to drop from 3V to 1.35V?
  Experiment with your Lab 2 PCB. Do you find that the state is maintained as long as you
  predicted? Make and report whether power was maintained at at least 6 measurement points
  (e.g., 10s, 20s, 30s, 60s, 90s, 120s). What might be missing from our model? How would you
  design a system to reliably run from a capacitor if you needed to?
  {: class="questions" start="2"}

In Lab 2, you used the timer interrupt to wake up the CPU periodically to control which LED was
lit on your PCB. For Labs 3 -- 5, we want to generate PWM signals, which will end up
potentially using both of the TimerA modules on the MSP430G2553. There is a third, easily
forgotten, timer module on the MSP430G2553, though. Before you look in the skeleton code for
Lab 3, see if you can remember what it is.

Now take a look at the [skeleton
code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ckemere/ELEC327/master/Labs/Lab3/lab3_skeleton.c). This
program follows the same code pattern as in Lab 2. Succinctly, this pattern involves a main
loop which contains the program logic. At the end of each main loop cycle, the device goes into
LPM3, and then the timer interrupt wakes it back up.
  
  3. What is the function of the function call `__bic_SR_register_on_exit(LPM3_bits);`? What
  would be the result to the program if we replaced this with `__bic_SR_register(LPM3_bits);`?
  4. (**not graded**) What clock sources can drive the ACLK? In which low power modes is only ACLK active? If
  we only want to enable the VLO when not in an interrupt, what low power mode should we put the
  MSP430 into?
  5. (**not graded**)  What is the difference in supply current between LPM1 (when SMCLK is set to 1 MHz from the
  DCO) and LPM3 (when ACLK is set to use the VLO)? Note that when the DCO is on, LPM1 power
  will be dominated by the DCO/DC generator and performance will be more like LPM0.
  6. In VLO-driven mode for the ACLK, what frequencies are available for the WDT+ interrupt?
  What code in the skeleton that sets the interrupt nominally at ~1.5 Hz? Why do we describe the
  WDT+ interrupt rates as "nominal"? (One answer has to do with the fact that 12 kHz divided by
  whatever is not exactly 1.5 Hz. That's not the answer I'm hoping for!)
  {: class="questions" start="3"}

##### PWM

To change the brightness of an LED (or most other analog devices), we use PWM. This essentially
changes the brightness by altering the duty cycle of the output signal. We could do this
manually -- i.e., write code using the timer interrupts that makes the appropriate output bit
high or low for the appropriate amount of time. However, many microcontrollers include special
hardware that allows for this to be done automatically. In the MSP430G2553, the two TimerA
modules can drive up to 3 pins each with PWM signals, with the limitation that the fundamental
frequency for the 3 pins must be the same -- the module's selected clock frequency. Because PWM
is a useful function for controlling intensity, the Timer modules are designed so that this
constraint will still let a variety of pulse patterns to be generated. Hence the various modes
(continuous, up, up/down). 

  7. The timer counter register (TAR) is 16-bits. Assuming we use the VLO to drive the Timer
  module at 12 kHz and run the counter in continuous mode (where it increments to 0xFFFF then
  overflows to 0x0), at what frequency will the TAR overflow? If we want our PWM modulation to not
  appear to flicker the minimum modulation frequency is about 100-200 Hz. Is this achievable if
  the TAR is configured to overflow?
  {: class="questions" start="7"}

The TimerA module allows us to set various pins to be on for a fraction of the timer counter
period, creating a PWM signal when it is pulsed fast enough. When learning how to configure
everything, it's worth understanding that different IOs of the Timer module can be connected to
different physical output pins. That's why when you look at the picture on the device
datasheet, you'll see multiple pins, for example, labeled `TA1.2`. The circuitry on the chip
that configures what connects to an output pin is a complicated multiplexer, usually referred
to as the "PinMux". In the device datasheet, the PinMux is described for the various pins
starting on page 42 with a series of diagrams and tables (for different groups of pins on
different pages!). You'll see in those tables that there are a set of registers, including
`P1SEL` and `P1SEL2` which configure the PinMux. BUT WAIT! The PinMux isn't everything. In
order to do PWM, you also need to configure the Timer module so that, e.g., the output
referred to in the table as `TA1.1` is actually properly generated. For this, you'll need to
look at the _User Guide_ chapter on the TimerA modules, specifically referencing output modes.
You'll need to change values of both `TACTL` and `TACCTLx`!!

  8. Say we want to use Timer A1 for our PWM signal. Which pins is register 1 of Timer A1
  capable of sending a PWM signal to? What should PxSEL, PxSEL2, and PxDIR be for these
  pins?
  9. (**not graded**) In up mode, the timer will continuously count up to the value in TA1CCR0,
  resetting to 0 every time it reaches it. If we want our output (using TA1CCR1) to be initially
  on for some fraction of each cycle and then turn off when TA1CCR1 is reached, what output mode
  should we put the capture compare block in?  How do we actually set it to this mode?
  10. To drive an RGB LED, you in general need 3 output pins. In general, what is the maximum
  number of PWM signals that can be generated by the Timer A1 module? What if the module
  is configured in up mode?
  11. If you had to generate 4 different PWM signals (i.e., using both Timer A1 and Timer A0)
  what is a valid set of 4 output pins? What if you were using Up mode (i.e., had to use CCR1
  and CCR2? _Is there a set of valid pins on the (hint) 20 pin device?_
  {: class="questions" start="8"}

Write some code to toss all this together. Source Timer A1 off the VLO clock, leaving it at its
default frequency. Configure your registers to use Up mode and so that the duty cycle of the
LED input signal is 50%, and make sure to enable the LPM found in b). Since the PWM signals are
automatically generated, you should not need an ISR.

  12. If you were to set CCR0 to be 500, why does the LED flicker and not dim?
  {: class="questions" start="12"}

##### Lab 3 programming task
For the lab demo, combine the PWM code you just wrote with the skeleton code and run it on your
Pendant from Lab 2. Your goal is to illuminate the outer and inner ring of LEDs, and for them
change intensity (duty cycle) from 0 to 100% and back to 0% in 5% steps each time the WDT interrupts.
Outer and inner should change in the opposite order, one getting brighter and one getting
dimmer.  **Demo this functionality and turn in your code.**
