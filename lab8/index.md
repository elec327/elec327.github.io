</div>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
#### Due Date: Last day of classes

The test code changes the color of the LED based on the potentiometer position. In
addition, the buzzer turns on and off at a specific potentiometer position.
The compiled test code can be found in [lab8_test.out](lab8_test.out). If you want to
look at it, the underlying code can be found in this CCS project, which you'll need to import as usual:
[lab8_test.zip](lab8_test.zip).
