### Lab #8: Soldering (Analog to Digital Conversion) (100 pts)

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
#### **There is one goal for this assignment:**

  - To demonstrate the functionality of your Lab 5 PCB
  
</div>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
#### Due Date: Last day of classes
#### **What should be turned in?**

Either turn in a video of the demo code running on your PCB or have one of the course
staff sign off that your PCB is functional.

The compiled test code can be found in [lab8_test.out](lab8_test.out). If you want to
look at it, the underlying code can be found in this CCS project, which you'll need to import as usual:
[lab8_test.zip](lab8_test.zip). Unfortunately a bug in CCS prevents the proper device (MSPS003F3)
from being chosen. So the project is configured for a MSPS003F4, which has 16K of memory instead of 8K.
Fixing this is complicated, but in the compiled code, it has been done. Reach out to Prof. Kemere
if you want to know more.
